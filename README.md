CAN4VSCP &lt;-> LoRa gateway

This project is a gateway that connects CAN4VSCP (a protocol for CAN bus communication) with LoRa (Long Range wireless communication). It allows for the transmission of CAN4VSCP messages over LoRa networks, enabling long-distance communication for CAN bus systems.

The module is based on the STM32H503 microcontroller and uses the EWM22A-900BWL22S BLE/WiFi/LoRa transceiver for wireless communication. It supports AES-128/192/256 CBC encryption for secure data transmission.

## Features
- Converts CAN4VSCP messages to LoRa format and vice versa
- Supports various LoRa configurations (frequency, spreading factor, etc.)
- Uses AES-128/192/256 CBC encryption for secure communication
- Easy integration with existing CAN4VSCP systems
- Open-source and customizable
