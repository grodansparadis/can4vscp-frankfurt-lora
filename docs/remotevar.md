# Remote Variables

*This section will contain remote variable definitions when implemented.*

Remote variables provide a standardized way to access module configuration and status information using VSCP events rather than register access.

## Standard Remote Variables

The Frankfurt module will implement standard VSCP remote variables:

- Module identification and version information
- Network status and statistics  
- Configuration parameters
- Diagnostic information

## LoRa-Specific Variables

Additional variables specific to LoRa functionality:

- RF signal strength and quality metrics
- Packet transmission statistics
- Network topology information
- Error counters and diagnostics

*Detailed variable definitions will be added during development.*
