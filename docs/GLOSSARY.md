# Glossary

## CAN
**Controller Area Network** - A robust vehicle bus standard designed for microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a host computer.

## CAN4VSCP  
**CAN for VSCP** - The VSCP specification for CAN bus networks, defining physical layer, power supply, and connector standards.

## Decision Matrix
**DM** - A table of rules that define conditions and actions for event processing, allowing intelligent filtering and response without firmware changes.

## DIN Rail
**Deutsche Industrie Norm Rail** - A metal rail used for mounting industrial control equipment in electrical panels.

## GUID
**Global Unique Identifier** - A 16-byte unique identifier assigned to each VSCP device.

## ISM Band
**Industrial, Scientific and Medical** - Radio bands reserved internationally for industrial, scientific and medical purposes.

## LoRa
**Long Range** - A low-power wide-area network modulation technique for long-range communication.

## RSSI
**Received Signal Strength Indicator** - A measurement of the power present in a received radio signal.

## SF
**Spreading Factor** - A LoRa modulation parameter that affects range vs data rate trade-off.

## SNR
**Signal-to-Noise Ratio** - The ratio of signal power to noise power, typically expressed in decibels.

## VSCP
**Very Simple Control Protocol** - An open-source automation protocol for IoT and M2M communication.

## VSCP4CAN
**VSCP for CAN** - VSCP implementation over CAN bus networks with standardized physical layer.
