![Frankfurt LoRa Gateway](/images/frankfurt-lora.png)

Frankfurt is a LoRa gateway module that bridges VSCP CAN4VSCP networks with LoRa radio networks. It enables long-range, low-power communication between VSCP devices using LoRa radio technology, extending the reach of VSCP networks beyond traditional wired CAN bus limitations.

The module features bidirectional event forwarding, configurable RF parameters, intelligent event filtering through a decision matrix, and seamless integration with existing VSCP4CAN infrastructure.

The module comes with a GUID and is programmed with a bootloader and VSCP module functionality that works right out of the box.
